# Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization

This repository provides code for our paper: [Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746).

## Reference
Here are the references for the code of previous real world benchmarks that are used in our experiments:
1. SVM, Mopta08 are taken from [BAxUS](https://github.com/LeoIV/BAxUS/).
2. Rover is taken from [EBO](https://github.com/zi-w/Ensemble-Bayesian-Optimization).
3. NAS201 is taken from [MCTS-VS](https://github.com/lamda-bbo/MCTS-VS).
